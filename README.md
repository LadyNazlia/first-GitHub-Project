# first-GitHub-Project
This is the first project I'm doing on my own on GitHub to learn how to use it.

I've been coding off and on since high school with Visual Basic and in college with C++, but now that I'm teaching Java to my AP CSA students, I want to really get into and I'm starting here. (Kind of.)
